Description: It implements the methodology censored bent line quantile regression. In the first step, it estimates an informative subset. In the second step, it estimates a bent line quantile regression model. The estimation of the change points is based on grid search, and the estimation of regression coeï¬ƒcients is based on rq in the package quantreg. The standard errors and the interval estimates are provided.
